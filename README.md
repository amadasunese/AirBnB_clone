AirBnB clone - The console
The AirBnB console project is about creating a copy of AirBnB,

command interpreter or console
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

how to start it:
./console.py command is used to start the console

How to used:

manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interprete
store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
Commands: create, show, destroy, all (shows all), update, help, quit

Example how to open:
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
